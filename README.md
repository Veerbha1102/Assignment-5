# Python Module 6: Data Structures and Strings - Assignment 5

This repository contains the solutions for Assignment 5 of Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python.

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks (`task1_student_marks.py`)

This program demonstrates the use of Python dictionaries.
1.  It initializes a dictionary mapping student names (keys) to their marks (values).
2.  It prompts the user to enter a student's name.
3.  It retrieves the corresponding marks using the `.get()` method.
4.  If the student is found, it prints the marks; otherwise, it prints an error message.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing (`task2_list_slicing.py`)

This program illustrates various list manipulation techniques using slicing:
1.  It creates a list containing numbers from 1 to 10.
2.  It uses slicing (`[0:5]`) to extract the first five elements.
3.  It uses extended slicing (`[::-1]`) to reverse the extracted list.
4.  It prints the original, extracted, and reversed lists, demonstrating the effect of slicing.
